**Updated (7/18/20):**

This is a Website all about me!  Really and truly I built this Website from Nothing in order to show Employers and Others on what Work I am able to do in the Web Developer field.  Using React, It displays what I can do, past works, contact information, etc.  A lot of time and effort was put into making this site look nice and I learned a ton along the way.
